Deep Learning, a 5-course specialization by deeplearning.ai on Coursera. Specialization Certificate earned on March 3, 2018".

The specialization is divided into 5 different courses : 

Course 1: Neural Networks and Deep Learning
Course 2: Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization
Course 3: Structuring Machine Learning Projects
Course 4: Convolutional Neural Networks
Course 5: Sequence Models

## Disclaimer ##

Code and projects from this repository, are my personal solutions and are only given for reference purpose. Please don't copy them.

## Note ##
I only added the projects I made for this specialization, I will not provide solutions to the quiz.

Please note that for the first 2 courses, full projects are given on this GitHub.
For the last 2 courses, only my Jupiter Notebook is provided due to space restriction. I will provide them later on a google drive.
